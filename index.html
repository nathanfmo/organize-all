        <h3>A guide to note-taking methods</h3>
        <p>Note-taking is an effective practice for retaining and reviewing 
        what you've learned. Whether you'd like to improve on your current 
        system or learn your first system, this guide is for you.

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>When I first entered high school, I had gotten along fine without 
        taking any notes. I had no idea what "studying" even referred to 
        outside of doing homework and projects. Running smack-dab into the 
        wall that was my first difficult class was a wake-up call with 
        consequences in the form of bad grades.<br>
        I knew things had to change, and so I went about researching what 
        it was to study and learn effectively. One of the biggest changes 
        I experimented with was note-taking. I went through a lot of 
        iterations of note-taking systems, and I recorded the pros and cons 
        of each. It was never my intention to share this information with 
        anyone outside of my organization mentees, but it's a resource that 
        will hopefully will help you in the same way it has helped me!
